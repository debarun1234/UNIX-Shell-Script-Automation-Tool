# 🛠️ UNIX Shell Script Automation Tool

A powerful Python-based tool that automates commenting of lines in UNIX `.sh` scripts based on user-defined exclusion keywords, with intelligent section tracking, full-block commenting, renumbering, and global replacements.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Parses `.sh` scripts and identifies `Section N:` blocks (with case-insensitive and position-flexible matching)
- 📝 Accepts a `.txt` file with comma-separated exclusion keywords
- 🔍 Scans each section for keyword matches and comments matching lines
- 🧠 Tracks which sections were modified
- ❌ Fully comments out the entire section (`if`, lines, and `fi`) if all lines get commented
- 🔢 Automatically renumbers remaining sections using `Section N:` logic, even inside commented lines
- 🔁 Globally replaces all variants of `bdi` (`_bdi_`, `_bdi`, `bdi_`, `bdi`) with `"war"`
- 📄 Optional changelog summary with section-wise breakdown and renumbering map
- 💡 Skips originally commented lines (doesn't double-comment)
- 🔐 Works on mixed-style shell scripts with `; then fi`, varying indentation, and flexible formats

## 🧪 Sample Output

**Input Section:**
```bash
if JobStep "Section 3: Data Transformation" ; then
Template="Customer"
Sort --column name
GetTransNode
normalize_data
fi
```

**After running the tool with matching keywords:**
```bash
#if JobStep "Section 2: Data Transformation" ; then
# Template="Customer"
# Sort --column name
# GetTransNode
# normalize_data
#fi
```

> If all lines in a section are commented, it comments the entire block and renumbers subsequent sections.

**Changelog Example:**
```
===== CHANGELOG SUMMARY =====
Sections with keyword-based commenting:
  • Section 2
  • Section 4

Sections fully commented-out and removed:
  • Original Section 2

Renumbering applied to remaining sections:
  • 1 → 1
  • 4 → 2
  • 5 → 3
  • 6 → 4

Global replacements:
  • All occurrences of '_bdi', '_bdi_', 'bdi_', 'bdi' → 'war'
=============================
```

## 🧠 Supported Replacements

After script processing, the tool will also replace these variants globally:

| Original   | Replaced With |
|------------|----------------|
| `_bdi_`    | `war`          |
| `_bdi`     | `war`          |
| `bdi_`     | `war`          |
| `bdi`      | `war`          |
